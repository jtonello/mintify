        Retrieves the list of entries matching the expressed search criteria.
        The pair `from` and `to` and the `cursor` parameter are mutually exclusive. If you supply a `from` and `to` you must not supply a `cursor` and vice-versa.
        The time criteria is required and can be specified in two different ways:
        - Using `from` and `to`, the list of entries within the timeframe (max 2 weeks) will be returned, starting from the most recent ones.
        - Using a `cursor` the entries returned will be in the before, after or around the entry, depending on the entry the cursor is taken from and the cursor type. More details are available in the `cursor` attribute in the response.
        The entry content can be filtered using `zones`, to select one or more zones, or with the filter, directly expressing a condition on fields and labels.

      summary: Delete Bundle
      description: |
        Deletes an existing Rule Bundle only if it is not used by any Policy.
        An HTTP error is returned if the Bundle being deleted is the only one currently attached to any Policy.
        Once deleted, subsequent calls to the Service will not return that Bundle anymore.
        However, some instances of the Inline Scanner might be running concurrently and may have already downloaded a Policy containing that Bundle.

      description: |
        Query language expression for filtering results.
        The filter is the result of logical concatenations,
        using "and" and "or" binary operators and the "not" unary prefix operator (i.e. `pid = 1 and not ppid = 2`),
        of attribute comparisons. Attribute comparisons can be:
        - scalar, using `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<` and `<=` comparison operators (i.e. `pid = 1`)
        - vector, using `in` to check the equality among one of the values provided between parenthesis (i.e. `pid in (1, 2)`)
        Depending on the attribute, only some operators can be available.
        Values containing double-quotes `"` need escaping using backslash `\`, i.e. name = "sample \"quoted\" value".
        The list of supported attributes and related operators supported can be retrieved through the
        `/secure/events/v1/supported-filters` endpoint.
        `freeText` is available as an additional attribute to provide free-text search capabilities.
        `freeText` supports the operators `=` (match) and `!=` (does not match).

        EBNF:
        ```
        attribute             = ? all available attributes ? ;
        value                 = ? attribute value ? ;
        quoted_value          = "\"", value, "\"" ;
        bin_operator          = "and" | "or";
        cmp_scalar_operator   = "=" | "!=" | ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" ;
        cmp_vector_operator   = "in";
        cmp_scalar_operation  = attribute, [" "], cmp_scalar_operator, [" "], quoted_value ;
        values_list           = "(", quoted_value, { [" "], ",", quoted_value }, ")" ;
        cmp_vector_operation  = attribute, " ", cmp_vector_operator, [" "], values_list ;
        freetext_operation    = "freeText ", "=" | "!=", quoted_value ;
        element               = ["not "], (cmp_scalar_operation | cmp_vector_operation | freetext_operation) ;
        filter                = element, {" ", bin_operator, " ", element} ;

            Specifies the type of component. For software components, classify as application if no more specific appropriate classification is available or cannot be determined for the component. Types include:

            * __application__ = A software application. Refer to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software) for information about applications.
            * __framework__ = A software framework. Refer to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework) for information on how frameworks vary slightly from libraries.
            * __library__ = A software library. Refer to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing))
             for information about libraries. All third-party and open source reusable components will likely be a library. If the library also has key features of a framework, then it should be classified as a framework. If not, or is unknown, then specifying library is RECOMMENDED.
            * __container__ = A packaging and/or runtime format, not specific to any particular technology, which isolates software inside the container from software outside of a container through virtualization technology. Refer to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization)
            * __platform__ = A runtime environment which interprets or executes software. This may include runtimes such as those that execute bytecode or low-code/no-code application platforms.
            * __operating-system__ = A software operating system without regard to deployment model (i.e. installed on physical hardware, virtual machine, image, etc) Refer to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)
            * __device__ = A hardware device such as a processor, or chip-set. A hardware device containing firmware SHOULD include a component for the physical hardware itself, and another component of type 'firmware' or 'operating-system' (whichever is relevant), describing information about the software running on the device.
              See also the list of [known device properties](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-property-taxonomy/blob/main/cdx/device.md).
            * __device-driver__ = A special type of software that operates or controls a particular type of device. Refer to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver)
            * __firmware__ = A special type of software that provides low-level control over a devices hardware. Refer to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware)
            * __file__ = A computer file. Refer to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file) for information about files.
            * __machine-learning-model__ = A model based on training data that can make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
            * __data__ = A collection of discrete values that convey information.

        - Scalar: Using `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<` and `<=` comparison operators. For example, `pid = 1`.
        - Vector: Using `in` to check the equality among the values provided between parenthesis. For example, `pid in (1, 2)`.
        The operators available depends on the attribute.
        Values containing double-quotes `"` need escaping using backslash `\`, i.e. name = "sample \"quoted\" value".
        You can retrieve the list of supported attributes and related operators through the
        `/secure/activity-audit/v1/supported-filters` endpoint.
        `freeText` is available as an additional attribute to provide free-text search capabilities.
        `freeText` supports the operators `=` (match) and `!=` (does not match).

        EBNF:
        ```
        attribute             = ? all available attributes ? ;
        value                 = ? attribute value ? ;
        quoted_value          = "\"", value, "\"" ;
        bin_operator          = "and" | "or";
        cmp_scalar_operator   = "=" | "!=" | ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" ;
        cmp_vector_operator   = "in";
        cmp_scalar_operation  = attribute, [" "], cmp_scalar_operator, [" "], quoted_value ;
        values_list           = "(", quoted_value, { [" "], ",", quoted_value }, ")" ;
        cmp_vector_operation  = attribute, " ", cmp_vector_operator, [" "], values_list ;
        freetext_operation    = "freeText ", "=" | "!=", quoted_value ;
