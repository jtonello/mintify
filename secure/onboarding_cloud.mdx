    <img
      src="/images/aws_account_id_small.png"
      style={{ height:"auto",width:"200px" }}
    />

    </div>

    - Sign in to the **AWS Console**. For an **Organization**, ensure you sign in to your organization's management account.
    - Expand the dropdown in the top right corner of the **AWS Console** and copy your **Account ID**.

      You can also get your AWS AccountID by using this command via AWS CLI or the AWS Console terminal:

      ```
      aws sts get-caller-identity \
          --query Account \
          --output text
      ```
    - _Optional Organization Unit IDs._ By default, your entire AWS Organization will be onboarded. If you want to restrict onboarding to a subset of your Organization, you can gather specific OUIDs now and enter them in the following steps.

        In Step 3, you can onboard a subset of your Organization Accounts by entering the OUIDs in a comma-separated list. Leave the field blank to onboard your entire Organization.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Generate Terraform file">
        In Step 4, click the **Next** button to generate a `main.tf` file to use with Terraform. Copy its contents and paste them into a new file, or download the file to an empty folder on your workstation, such as `/home/user/sysdig_onboarding`.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Execute Terraform">
        - On your **workstation**, navigate using the CLI to the folder containing your main.tf file and execute the following commands:

        ```
        $ cd /home/user/sysdig_onboarding   # Your main.tf file location
        $ terraform init && terraform apply

    - For **Organization** accounts, in Step 2, enter your **AWS management account ID** and your OUID(s). For a **Single Account**, enter only your **AWS Account ID**.
    - In Step 3, click the **Launch Stack** button. This will shift you to an **AWS console** browser window. Follow any prompts in AWS to deploy the required resources, and be sure to check the Acknowledgements in the AWS Capabilities section.
    - When CloudFormation completes, click the **Complete Onboarding** button in the Sysdig dashboard. Your newly added account will appear in the Cloud Accounts page.

    ## 5. Check the Connection

    - To validate your AWS connection, navigate to Sysdig Secure's **Integrations** \> **Environments** \> **AWS**.
    - Click the **Added On** column heading to show the most recently added account on top.
    - The **Status** column shows the overall connection status:
      - Connected

      ### Permissions Granted to Sysdig

      The above installation creates two IAM Roles that Sysdig can access. These Roles have the following permissions:

      - A role named `sysdig-secure-onboarding-XXXX`, used to manage the base integration with Sysdig
        - AWSAccountManagementReadOnlyAccess
        - AWSOrganizationsReadOnlyAccess (Organizational install)
      - A role named `sysdig-secure-posture-XXXX`,used to collect an inventory of cloud resources and perform CSPM
        - SecurityAudit
        - A Custom IAM Policy containing the following permissions:
          - `account:GetContactInformation`
          - `elasticfilesystem:DescribeAccessPoints`

      ### Identities

      Two [AWS identities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html) are required in the onboarding process:

      - _Installer_: Either an AWS user or a role used to perform the onboarding. Sysdig does not have access to this identity.
      - _Sysdig_: A set of IAM Roles created during onboarding with specific, less permissive permissions attached. Sysdig is given access to these roles.

      ### Security Principals

      The onboarding process involves two [security principals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-security-principals):

      - Installer: The primary security principal, either a User or a Service Principal. This security principal will be used to perform the onboarding. Sysdig does not have access to this security principal.
      - Sysdig: A Service Principal (robot user) created during onboarding with specific, less permissive roles. Sysdig will be given access to this security principal.

      ### Azure Role Types

      Azure Identity and Access Management (IAM) is separated into two control planes:

      - [Entra ID Roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/custom-overview): Applied to the entire Tenant.
      - [Azure RBAC Roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview): Applied to the Subscription or Management Group being onboarded.

      ## Prerequisites
    </Accordion>
    - Sysdig Secure SaaS with Admin permissions
    - Terraform v1.5.0+ installed
    - Azure CLI installed. See [How to install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
    - A security principal with the permissions required to install, as mentioned in [Security Principals](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/sysdig-secure/connect-azure/#security-principals). For the required permissions, see [Permissions Required to Install](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/sysdig-secure/azure-permissions-and-resources/#base-azure-integration---cloud-security-posture-management-cspm). To grant permissions, you need:
      - `SP_ID`: Your Installer security principal ID. To retrieve this, open the Azure CI and use the command `az ad sp list --display-name "terraform-runner" --query "[0].appId" --output tsv`.
      - `ROOT_MANAGEMENT_GROUP_ID`: Your Root Management Group ID. To retrieve this, open the Azure CLI and use the command `az account management-group list --query "[].{name:name, id:id}" --output tsv`.

    ## Prepare Your Environment

    ### 1. Configure Installation Permissions

    Ensure the principal you log in to Azure with has the [necessary roles and permissions](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/sysdig-secure/azure-permissions-and-resources/#base-azure-integration---cloud-security-posture-management-cspm) to install. You can:

    - Use an existing principal who meets the permissions requirements.
    - Create a new principal and set up permissions.
    - Add permissions to an existing principal.

    1. Log in to Azure.
    2. Check Entra ID Roles:
       - Navigate to the Entra ID console and select Roles and Administrators.
       - Verify and add necessary roles.
    3. Check Azure RBAC Roles:
       - For Single Subscriptions: Navigate to Subscriptions, select the target subscription, and verify roles.
       - For Management Groups: Navigate to Management Groups, select the target group, and verify roles.

    ### 2. Authenticate and Configure Terraform

    A common way to do this is:

    1. Ensure you are logged in to the correct Tenant.\
       Log in using the Azure CLI:

    ```
    az login --tenant "TENANT_ID_OR_DOMAIN"
    ```

    2. You will be presented with a web page to select your user account. Be sure to log in as the user you configured in Step 1.
    3. Confirm you are logged in as the correct user by running:

    ```
    az ad signed-in-user show
    
    ```

    4. For alternative ways to authenticate Terraform, see the Terraform documentation: [Authenticating to Azure Active Directory](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azuread/latest/docs#authenticating-to-azure-active-directory) and [Authenticating to Azure](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs#authenticating-to-azure).

    ### 3. Collect your Azure Tenant ID and Subscription ID

    #### Tenant ID

    1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
    2. Navigate to Microsoft Entra ID \> Properties.
    3. Scroll down to the Tenant ID section.
    4. Find your tenant ID in the box.
    5. Select the Copy to clipboard icon shown next to the Tenant ID.
    6. Store this value. You can paste this value into a text document or other location.

    #### Subscription ID

    1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
    2. Under the Azure services heading, select Subscriptions. If you don’t see Subscriptions here, use the search box to find it.
    3. Find the subscription in the list, and note the Subscription ID shown in the second column. If no subscriptions appear, or you don’t see the right one, you may need to switch directories to show the subscriptions from a different Microsoft Entra tenant.
    4. To easily copy the Subscription ID, select the subscription name to display more details. Select the Copy to clipboard icon shown next to the Subscription ID in the Essentials section. You can paste this value into a text document or other location.
