<div style={{ fontSize:"24px" }}>
This topic describes how to connect your AWS environment to Sysdig Secure. You can connect Single Accounts or entire Organization Accounts using Terraform or CloudFormation.

</div>

## 1. Prerequisites

- A **Sysdig Secure administrator** account.
- An **AWS user or role** with permission to install [IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html), as shown in the table below.
- A local workstation with **Terraform v1.5+** installed or access to **CloudFormation**.

<Accordion title="Click to Learn More About Using Terraform and AWS CLI">
  - For Terraform, use the command line to export your AWS keys, or see the [AWS Terraform Provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#authentication-and-configuration) for other ways to authenticate.

  ```
      export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="anaccesskey"
      export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="asecretkey"
      export AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
  ```

  If you're using [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), run `aws configure` from your workstation command line or edit the `/home/user/.aws/credentials` file:

  From the CLI, it will look something like this:

  ```
  AWS Access Key ID [****************L64C]: 
  AWS Secret Access Key [****************5JsZ]: 
  AWS Session Token [****************y2Cp]: 
  Default region name [us-east-1]: 
  Default output format [None]:          # Leave blank
  ```

  ```
  [default]
  aws_access_key_id=****************L64C
  aws_secret_access_key=****************5JsZ
  aws_session_token=****************y2Cp   # A long value sometimes necessary for orgranizations using SSO
  ```

  You can also set your default AWS region as part of `aws configure` or set it in `/home/user/.aws/config` by adding:

  ```
  [default]
  region = us-east-1      # Set to your region
  ```

  Check your workstation's connection and authentication with AWS with this AWS CLI command:

  ```
  aws sts get-caller-identity
  ```

  To get your AWS Account ID, use this command via AWS CLI or the AWS Console terminal:

  ```
  aws sts get-caller-identity \
      --query Account \
      --output text
  ```

  To see the **roles** associated with your account, use this command via AWS CLI or the AWS Console terminal:

  ```
  aws iam list-roles
  ```

  To see the **policies** associated with your account, use this command via AWS CLI or the AWS Console terminal:

  ```
  aws iam list-policies
  ```

## 2. Collect Your Account Details

<img
  src="./images/aws_account_id_small.png"
  style={{ height:"auto",width:"200px" }}
  noZoom={true}
/>

</div>

- Sign in to the **AWS Console**. For an **Organization**, ensure you sign in to your organization's management account.
- Expand the dropdown in the top right corner of the **AWS Console** and copy your **Account ID**.
- _Optional Organization Unit IDs._ By default, your entire AWS Organization will be onboarded. If you want to restrict onboarding to a subset of your Organization, you can gather specific OUIDs now and enter them in the following steps.

## 3. Connect with Terraform

<div style={{ float:"right",padding:"10px" }}>
<img
  src="./images/wizard.png"
  width="400"
/>

</div>

- Log in to **Sysdig Secure**.
- Click **Integrations** at the bottom of the main left-hand navigation menu, and choose **AWS Cloud Accounts**.
- Choose whether to connect an AWS **Organization** or a **Single Account**.
- For **Organization** accounts, In Step 2, enter your **AWS management Account ID** and select your **Primary Region**. For **Single Accounts**, enter only your **AWS Account ID**.
- In Step 3, you can onboard a subset of your Organization Accounts by entering the OUIDs in a comma-separated list. Leave the field blank to onboard your entire Organization.
- In Step 4, click the **Next** button to generate a `main.tf` file to use with Terraform. Copy its contents and paste them into a new file, or download the file to an empty folder on your workstation, such as `/home/user/sysdig_onboarding`.
- On your **workstation**, navigate using the CLI to the folder containing your main.tf file and execute the following commands:

```
$ cd /home/user/sysdig_onboarding   # Your main.tf file location
$ terraform init && terraform apply
```

- When Terraform completes, click the **Complete Onboarding** button in the Sysdig Secure dashboard. Your newly added account will appear in the **Cloud Accounts** page.

## 4. Connect with CloudFormation

- Log in to **Sysdig Secure**.
- In a separate browser window, log in to your **AWS Account**. For Organization installs, be sure to log into your Organization's Management Account.
- For **Organization** accounts, in Step 2, enter your **AWS management account ID** and your OUID(s). For a **Single Account**, enter only your **AWS Account ID**.
- In Step 3, click the **Launch Stack** button. This will shift you to an **AWS console** browser window. Follow any prompts in AWS to deploy the required resources, and be sure to check the Acknowledgements in the AWS Capabilities section.
- When CloudFormation completes, click the **Complete Onboarding** button in the Sysdig dashboard. Your newly added account will appear in the Cloud Accounts page.

## 5. Check the Connection

- To validate your AWS connection, navigate to Sysdig Secure's **Integrations** \> **Environments** \> **AWS**.
- Click the **Added On** column heading to show the most recently added account on top.
- The **Status** column shows the overall connection status:
  - Connected
  - Error
  - Needs Attention
  - Unknown

Select the desired AWS account to review the individual services in the detail drawer. There you can view the status of each feature you've enabled.

  ### Identities

  Two [AWS identities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html) are required in the onboarding process:

  - _Installer_: Either an AWS user or a role used to perform the onboarding. Sysdig does not have access to this identity.
  - _Sysdig_: A set of IAM Roles created during onboarding with specific, less permissive permissions attached. Sysdig is given access to these roles.
