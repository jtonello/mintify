    </Tip>
    Open a support ticket by filling in the [web-based form](https://cx.sysdig.com/s/web-to-case). It's important to provide Sysdig Support with relevant information about your system, including:

    ### Specify Ticket Details

    Add details in the Description box. See below for tips on what to enter:

    ```
    Operating System:
    
    Orchestrator:
    
    Agent Version:
    
    Company Name:
    ```

    #### Operating System

    Review Host Requirements for Agent Installation to confirm that your operating system is supported.

    Submitting the output of uname -a and lsb_release -a will help Sysdig support determine if the kernel is supported.

    If you have a custom kernel and the kernel development headers are not available, you will not be able to install our agent.

    Also note if the Linux distribution used inside your application’s container is not the same as the host.

    <Note>
      lsb_release is part of a software package called the LSB core, which is not necessarily installed on your system by default. If it is not installed, see https://wiki.itcollege.ee/index.php/Lsb_release
    </Note>
    #### Orchestrator Details

    When using the Sysdig agent in an orchestration infrastructure, such (Kubernetes, GKE, etc., submit the details of how the the infrastructure was installed.

    For example:

    - Which Kubernetes version
    - The cloud provider being run under (AWS, GKE, etc.)
    - The number of nodes
    - The authentication method configured for the API server

    #### Agent Version

    To verify which agent version you are running, either:

    - On the product UI, see Select Integrations \> Data Sources \> Sysdig Agent.
    - Use the following command:

    **Agent in a non-container environment**:

    ```
    /opt/draios/bin/dragent --version
    ```

    **Agent in a container**:

    ```
    sudo docker exec -it <container_id> /opt/draios/bin/dragent --version
    ```

    **Agent in Kubernetes**:

    ```expandable
    kubectl -n sysdig-agent exec -ti <agent_pod> -c sysdig -- bash -c "/opt/draios/bin/dragent --version"
    ```

    Known issues may be resolved by upgrading to the latest agent version.

    Agent release numbers are shown in the agent build list, and agent release notes can be accessed from the Release Notes
